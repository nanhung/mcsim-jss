MCSim is a simulation package which allows you to design your own
model (eventually dynamic, via ODEs) and to perform Monte Carlo
stochastic simulations, or Bayesian inference through Markov Chain
Monte Carlo simulations.

MCSim is GNU software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version.

The latest version (4.2.0) of the package, written in C, is available in
original source code. You should be able to compile it on any machine
of your choice. You will need a C compiler. For Unix machines we
recommend GNU's gcc, although other compilers (e.g. c89) might work.

Contact us by e-mail: fbois@sparky.berkeley.edu for more information,
or check the Web page http://sparky.berkeley.edu/users/fbois/mcsim.

The package is distributed as a compressed tar archive which
contains:

  A User's Manual (under texinfo, postscript and HTML formats)
  The source code Mod program to preprocess your models
  The source code for the MCSim routines to link to your models
  Examples of model and simulation files

You should read the User's Manual before attempting to use the
software.  Check also the Manual-Update.txt file for last minute
updates and tips. Finally, the How-to-install.txt file describes
instalation procedures.
