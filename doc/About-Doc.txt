The users's manual for MCSim is provided as:

mcsim.texinfo: the basic text, which can be processed by GNU texinfo
               to generate all the following formats and GNU info files
               (refer to GNU info for more info...).

mcsim.dvi:     a dvi file produced by TeX from mcsim.texinfo. You can
               process this dvi file with dvips to generate a ps file.

               it to a postscript printer (on Macintosh the LaserWriter
               Utility can do that).
