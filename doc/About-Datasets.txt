************************************
The following sample datasets and corresponding models are provided only 
online, as examples of use of the software.

 - A dichloromethane toxicokinetic model for mice. The included files
   should allow the lucky you to reproduce an analysis performed for
   the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration. You need to
   have installed MCSim, and understood the manual to use those files. 
   A technical report giving important (or even necessary) background
   to this model is available from Dr. Christine Whittaker Sofge -
   OSHA Health Standards Policy Division - HSP-OSHA-DOL - Rm. N3718 -
   200 Constitution Ave. NW - Washington, DC 20210,
   (email: CWhitake@dol.gov).

   The files are:
   
   - dcm.mouse.model: the model definition file.

   - dcm.mouse.rst  : a restart file containing a parameter vector from the
                      (approximate) joint posterior distribution of all 
                      parameter. If you use it as a starting point for 
                      Markov chain simulations you should quickly reach
                      equilibrium.

   - dcm.mouse.MCMC.in : a simulation file for Markov chain Monte Carlo
                         simulations. Uses dcm.mouse.rst as restart file.

   - dcm.mouse.fit.in  : a simple simulation file to help you check quality
                         of data predictions ("fit").

   - dcm.mouse.metab.in : a SetPoint simulation file to produce predictions
                          relevant to cancer risk assessment. It uses the 
                          output of the dcm.mouse.MCMC.in file as source of
                          parameter vectors.

***
 - A model similar to the above for dichloromethane toxicokinetics in 
   humans. The corresponding files are:

   - dcm.human.model
   - dcm.human.rst
   - dcm.human.MCMC.in
   - dcm.human.fit.in
   - dcm.human.metab.in
   - mh.human.c : a special code file that you should use instead of mh.c
     when compiling the human simulation program for MCMC simulations.
     The function LnLikeData has been customized to use the SDs reported
     for each data point in the human dataset.

************************************
Additional sample files (for a linear model, a discrete-time model etc.) 
are included with the source code.
